Tools used:

jQuery /
jQuery Template /
Codebird /
Css via less

/***********************/

jQuery Template:

	- Used to load each one of the tweets, I like to use this library because I think is cleaner than create an append in the scripts file to load all the content pulled from de Twitter service

Codebird

	- Is the first time I use this one, but I think it was really easy and helpful in order to authenticate the Twitter app and to call the service.

Less

	- I like to use less in my projects since it is a great way to write css with variables so you can reuse code and don't need to write the same thing over and over and over.
